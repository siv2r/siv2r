### Hello there, I am Sivaram - aka siv2r
I'm a cryptography engineer currently working on libsecp256k1, the library powering Bitcoin's digital signatures. Most days, you'll find me implementing or reviewing cryptographic protocols like [FROST Signing](https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing), [ChillDKG](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/bip-frost-dkg/commits/master?author=siv2r), [Schnorr adaptor signatures](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp/pull/299), and [Batch verification](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1). In short, I spend my time making math do some pretty cool things. My work is supported through open-source developer grants, and right now, I'm grateful to be a [Spiral grantee](https://x.com/spiralbtc/status/1813233378042474520).

I'm particularly fascinated by provable security in cryptography and am steadily developing my expertise in this area. Publishing a research paper is one of my big aspirations. Additionally, I run a Substack newsletter called [*Nonce Sense*](https://siv2r.substack.com/), where I simplify cryptographic concepts and share updates on my work.

I graduated in 2023 with an Integrated Masters (BS + MS) in Mathematics and Computing from [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/). Outside of work, youâ€™ll likely find me lifting weights, binge-reading a novel, or daydreaming about playing basketball more often.
